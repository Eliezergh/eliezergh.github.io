Welcome to my personal and minimalistic blog.

This blog is generated by **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io)** and deployed on **[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**.

The main purpose of this little project is to play & have fun investigating about Hugo & Github, so it would lasts as much as I get bored about this.

For now, my intention is to create small posts with "How-To(s)" or tips about the different tools I use on my daily basis. 

You'll find more information about me on **[about](https://eliezer.github.io/about)** section.

If you're still here, thanks for invest your time reading this.
