Hi! Let me introduce myself. 

My name is **Eliezer Gonz√°lez**, and I'm currently working as a **DevOps Engineer** for a worldwide sportswear brand. 

With more than 8 years of experience in IT and almost 3 years of experience working with DevOps technologies, I'm currently leading my team through an awesome journey working with Atlassian tools, Amazon Web Services, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes and much more CI/CD-related technologies.

Don't hesitate to reach out to me if needed. You'll find contact details on the left side of the screen.
